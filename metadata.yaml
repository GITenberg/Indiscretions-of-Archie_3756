description: "Indiscretions of Archie is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published\
  \ in the United Kingdom on 14 February 1921 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the\
  \ United States on 15 July 1921 by George H. Doran, New York.\nThe book was adapted\
  \ from a series of short stories, originally serialised in the Strand in the United\
  \ Kingdom between March 1920 and February 1921, and, all except one, in Cosmopolitan\
  \ in the United States between May 1920 and February 1921. The stories were rewritten\
  \ and reorganised to create a more flowing novel form.\nThe one story that was not\
  \ published in Cosmopolitan, \"Strange Experience of an Artist's Model\", was collected\
  \ in Wodehouse on Crime (1981) under the title \"Indiscretions of Archie\".\n From\
